/**
 * Returns a dictionary containing the names and classes of all the properties of

 * represent the class used to encode each property (e.g. `NSString` for strings,
 * `NSNumber` for numeric values or booleans, `NSValue` for structs, etc).
 *
 * This dictionary is automatically generated by scanning the properties defined
 * in the class definition at runtime. Read-only and private properties will also
 * be coded as long as they have KVC-compliant ivar names (i.e. the ivar matches
 * the property name, or is the same but with a _ prefix). Any properties that
 * are not backed by an ivar, or whose ivar name does not match the property name
 * will not be encoded (this is a design feature, not a limitation - it makes it
 * easier to exclude properties from encoding)
 *
 * It is not normally necessary to override this method unless you wish to add
 * ivars for coding that do not have matching property definitions, or if you
 * wish to code virtual properties (properties or setter/getter method pairs that
 * are not backed by an ivar). If you wish to exclude certain properties from the
 * serialisation process, you can deliberately give them an non KVC-compliant
 * ivar name (see above).
 *
 * Note that this method only returns the properties defined on a particular
 * class and not any properties that are inherited from its superclasses. You
 * *do not* need to call `[super codableProperties]` if you override this method.
